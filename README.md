The project aims to address the following questions related to a university database:

1. Distribution of the number of enrolled students in various exams, broken down by years and by degree program.
2. Identification of the Top-10 most challenging exams, divided by course of study.
3. The most difficult exam refers to the exam with the highest overall passing rate, considering all exams in the academic year. Passing rate is understood as the "number of students who passed the exam" (Table: Enrollments, Superamento column) over "number of students who participated in the exam."Identification of degree programs with a high commitment rate, i.e., exams of different courses of the same degree program held on the same day.
4. Identification of the Top-3 exams with the highest and lowest average grades, respectively, calculated for each individual course of study.
5. Calculate the distribution of "fast&furious" students by course of study, i.e., students with the ratio of "average grade in passed exams" to "activity period" greater. Activity period is defined as the number of days elapsed between the first exam taken (not necessarily passed) and the last one.
6. Identification of the Top-3 "trial&error" exams, i.e., exams that require the highest number of attempts before passing. For a course of study, the respective trial&error value is given by the average of the number of attempts (failures) for each student for each exam of the course.
7. Identification of the average grades of students based on their geographical origin and comparison of the average grades between males and females in various degree levels.
